This plugin was a result of a coding challenge with the following requirements:

- Build a WordPress-Plugin that adds some options to the database at its first
activation.

- The Plugin should add Google Analytics Tracking Code to every Page, it should be
possible for specific pages (not posts) to disable the Google Analytics Tracking Code
right from the WordPress page edit screen

- For using the Plugin on different Installations, add an option field to the Backend
where you can define the Google Analytics Tracking ID within an input field.

- When uninstalling (not deactivating) the plugin, all added options by this plugin
should be removed.

- The Plugin should also force a post with the slug ​ imprint ​ and a post with the ID ​ 1 ​ to
disallow indexing from search engines.
